<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Welcome to the daylighting variations-project.</FONT></B></P>

<P>This Internet page shows the impact of daylight-openings on
spaces. It is part of a new project in which a design tool is
being developed based on detailed daylighting simulations.</P>

<P>On the left and right edges of the screen you will find icons
showing the various solutions that have been calculated so far.
After selecting on the left and right two of these icons the corresponding
results for each solution are shown in the middle so they can
be easily compared. For each variation several views are offered
(see below). An overview of all variations is available <A HREF="overzicht_plaats.html" TARGET="_blank">here</A>. The variations are ordered by the number
of room-surfaces that the window(s) connect to.</P>

<P>The area of the daylight opening is equal in all variations
except for the one where the window connects to four surfaces
(A_4). In this case the whole fa&ccedil;ade is transparent. The
<I>area of the window</I> openings has been chosen as <I>10% of
the floor area</I> of the room. The room is a &#145;standard office
room&#146; of 3.6 x 5.4 x 2.7 m (W x D x H). The reflection factors
of the surfaces are: <I>Wall reflectance = 0.7, Ceiling reflectance
is 0.8, and Floor reflectance = 0.2. </I>All surfaces are assumed
to be perfectly diffuse reflectors.</P>

<P>The sky luminance distribution is modeled as a CIE standard
overcast sky. This is a common design situation. It gives an impression
of the room under minimal daylighting conditions. It also excludes
the effect of direct sunlight. Future work will deal with other
sky conditions.</P>

<P>The CIE overcast sky describes a sky condition with a relative
bright zenith and a luminance that decreases towards the horizon.
This is described by the equation:<BR>
