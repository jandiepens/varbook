<P>The zenith luminance (L<SUB>zenith</SUB>) is 4092 cd/m<SUP>2</SUP>.
This has been chosen in order to obtain a horizontal illuminance
(E) of 10000 lux in the unobstructed field.</P>

<P><B>Views</B></P>

<P>For each example the following views are currently offered:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Perspective across the room length
  <LI>Cross-section rendering
  <LI>View looking towards the floor
  <LI>Elevation of side wall
  <LI>Elevation of the rear wall (showing the door)
  <LI>False color image (same viewpoint as [2]) showing luminances
  <LI>Daylight factor distribution on the workplane (plan view,
  at 0.8 meters above floor)
  <LI>Daylight factor distribution on the workplace (cross-section,
  at 0.8 meters above the floor)
</OL>
