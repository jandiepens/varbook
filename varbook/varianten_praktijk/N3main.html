    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The school has the form of a square and is
    two stories high. In the middle a auditorium is placed surrounded
    by a ring of corridors and by an outlying ring of classrooms.
    From the second floor corridor one can view the activities in
    the auditorium. Also Daylight enters from the corridor into the
    auditorium as can be seen on the left picture. On the right photograph
    the second floor corridor can be seen with its windows to the
    auditorium. Daylight reflects from above against the wall into
    the corridor en through the windows in the auditorium.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As can be seen on the two left pictures the
    house has a closed facade facing the road and a open facade facing
    the garden providing for views on the overhanging trees. The
    only windows in the closed facade are placed nearby ground level
    protected by a grid of blocks or are slits providing for indirect
    natural light in the interior. On the first photograph on the
    right is to be seen how daylight from above enters the kitchen.
    It seems like the incoming daylight defines two separate areas
    in the room by the difference in luminance. The second picture
    shows the windows in the ceiling in greater detail.</FONT></P>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">The building, made of reinforced concrete, is
    placed partly below ground level. This to offer resistance to
    the strong seasonal winds and severe temperature differences
    between day and night and to prevent damaging the surrounding
    historical environment. The photograph on the right shows the
    interior of an exhibition hall. The wall that shows the paintings
    is lightened up by indirect daylight coming form the roof. The
    shelves and the diffuse glass make sure no direct sunlight shines
    upon the paintings.</FONT></TD>
