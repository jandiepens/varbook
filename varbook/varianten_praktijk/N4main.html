    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The designs of Aldo Rossi look austere but
    by the way he let light and space play around the materials gives
    the designs a strong appearance and own identity. The Bonnefanten
    Museum made of Dutch brick, Irish limestone and zinc has an industrial
    appearance. This fits in well with the historical context of
    the location. The interior is straightforward caused by the brick,
    timber floors and simple details. On the photograph on the right
    the monumental staircase can be seen. The enormous windows above
    the brick side-walls provide for daylight. It even looks like
    you're walking in the open air. The light brushes from above
    past the walls so the texture of the walls are good to been seen.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This bank was the first European project of
    Arquitectonica in Europe. It is located on an angle of the Boulevard
    Royal in the centre of the city. Arquitectonica has used several
    different forms to achieve an expression of progression. As you
    can see on the left picture one form exists of Chassagne stone
    with dark windows, one of tinted green glass and one of black
    granite. The form existing of glass at the bottom of the building
    gives daylight to the lower level banking hall. On the other
    picture you see that the hall obtains its light only from above
    because it is situated below ground level.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Richard Meier has a recognisable style making
    often use Modernist white forms on a geometrical grid with a
    great variety of expression. The City Hall and Central Library
    are located near the Central Station in the centre of The Hague.
    The alignment of the city streets inspired Richard Meier to introduce
    a 12.5&deg; rotation in the two main grids, corresponding two
    high buildingblocks. Between these blocks a 47 meter high atrium
    arises. As you can see on the picture, daylight coming from above
    also provides the offices situated nearby the atrium for light.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This building is an public place made of 
    brick, steel and timber. The building is designed in a way that
    it will be highly used. Visibly the whole blends well and lifts
    the overall quality. The use of bricks and woods creates a softly
    pleasant atmosphere. The form is robust and sympathetic so it
    will attract the people walking by. The glass roof structure
    in the middle of the building gives the interior an open atmosphere
    but also moderates the internal climate. The louvers are constructed
    in two layers in different directions to protect the building
    from blinding daylight. The structure can be seen on the second
    picture on the left.</FONT></P>
