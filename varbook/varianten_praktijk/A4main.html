    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Luis Barrag&aacute;n has shaped a very unique
    style, using abstract architecture from the modern language combined
    with solutions and materials out of the Mexican tradition.<BR>
    The house consists of simple geometrical forms and warm colours.
    He plays with light, shadows, colours and openings, which cause
    remarkeble spaces and compositions. On the left photograph you
    see the main facade of the house. On the right you see a piece
    of the living room. The window which provides for daylight seems
    to have no kozijnen.<BR>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Mario Botta is influenced by the Modern Movement
    (in the way of the treatment of details and materials) and by
    Frank Lloyd Wright (integration of architecture and landscape).
    He uses very simple geometrical forms. This building is plasec
    on (or more &quot;in&quot;) a mountainside. This building can
    be entered by a red metal bridge which penetrates the heart of
    the building. On the picture on the right you see a large window
    occupying one wall of the tripleheight living room. Radiators
    are placed beside the window over the total height of the room
    to ensure a good climate.</FONT></TD>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">The building is based on a combination of rectangles,
    squares, crosses, symmetry and contrasts. The south facade of
    the house opens to the sun and the valley while the north facade
    is closed and compact. The house contains of two cubic forms
    connected by a portico (supported by blue columns as you can
    see on the left photograph). You can walk through a corridor
    to the other part of the house. This can be seen on the right
    picture. Most of the light is coming through a door at the end
    of the corridor so the light guides you the way. The interior
    of the house is sober just like the outside, bur the soft tones
    cause warmth and enchant the daylight.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The original building is not situated on a
    very interesting location. To improve the view a number of attractive
    elements were added like a large patio at the entrance, terraces
    and a large wall pierced with two arches as you can see on the
    left picture. Nevertheless the original building has not been
    significantly changed. Only some walls have been replaced by
    window to provide for daylight. This can be seen on the right
    picture. A glass wall with metalwork makes daylight streaming
    into the living room and gives a nice view to the garden. Because
    of the daylight brushing past the ceiling the structure of it
    is easy to be seen.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Douroux House is built on Venice Beach.
    Its form looks like a narrow rectangular block built of concrete,
    glass and steel. One facade to the Pacific is very open and the
    other one facing the city is more closed. As you can see on the
    left picture the more closed facade has windows which provide
    for daylight and can be opened for fresh air, but you can't look
    into the house. This to give the occupants a greater privacy.
    On the ground floor the double-height living room is situated.
    It has a cubic form with large openings to the beach as you can
    see on the pictures. Especially the red extremely large window
    gets the attention. The floor of the living room contains out
    of two materials. The difference between these materials in combination
    with incoming daylight can be seen on the right pictures.</FONT></P>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">This house is built in a dune facing the North
    Sea. The only visible parts are the entry and two glass domes
    providing for daylight and a nice view to the sea. According
    to this principle light is coming from only one side into the
    deep rooms which causes a very dark interior as you can see on
    the right picture.</FONT></TD>
