    <FONT SIZE="-1">Villa Savoye represents the Modern Movement.
    The design was obtained by approaching the house as a machine
    for living. Characteristic are the elongated horizontal strips
    of windows and the use of pilotis to raise the construction off
    ground level. On the picture on the right you see daylight coming
    from a window close to the side-wall. According to this position
    light brushes past this blue wall so that roughness on the wall
    is easy to be seen.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This townhouse has had several owners and
    needed to be reconstructed. Spaces had to be created of human
    proportions. Also needed the building new services like air-conditioning.
    A consistent ceiling height gave the original structure a monotone
    character. New spaces were created out of a couple of old original
    spaces. An example can be seen on the right photograph. The windows
    in the originally upper level provide for daylight into the room
    beneath. Direct daylight enters the room and reflects against
    the walls so only indirect diffuse daylight reaches the table
    on the floor.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This house is situated between hills near
    Tokyo and has a view on the ocean. The house has the form of
    a cone with a slope adjusted to the surrounding hills.  The exterior
    walls and roof are finished with a aluminium alloy. The inside
    is finished in white plaster. In that way the architect has tried
    to give the occupant a feeling of enclosure. The extreme high
    ceiling (9.6 metres on the first floor and 7 on the second) are
    softened by the whiteness.  Windows are positioned in such a
    way that the rays of the red, setting sun can enter the room.
    This all gives the interior of the house a strong but also restful
    character.</FONT></P>
