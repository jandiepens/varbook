    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Dancers have very high and special demands
    for the floor, orientation-possibilities, sounds, and the condition
    of the air. But ideally dancers should be dancing in the sunlight
    surrounded by nature without restrictions. To combine these demands
    was quite a challenge for the architect. The dancestudio's he
    designed are surrounded by a corridor, offices and seminar rooms.
    The offices and seminar rooms have a sloped top towards the corridor.
    These sloping tops reflect daylight into the corridor and through
    a glass wall facing the reflecting tops into the dance studio.
    On the first photograph on the right the corridor can be seen
    and on the second one the interior of the dancestudio with the
    glass wall facing the reflectors.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The architect has tried to integrate this
    house with its natural surrounding by the use of natural materials
    like stone and wood. Balconies, roofs and terraces give the house
    a dynamic, disordered composition. The windows are very various-sized.
    The architect has played with the different views to the sky,
    shore and the trees. The double-height living room is bright.
    A large window below provides for daylight and a view to the
    bay. The window above brings the light more deeply into the room.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This building is designed to serve as a comprehensive
    crane museum. The museum has to attract tourists year-round and
    has to serve as a place for study. The building is located in
    a large riverbed of the Yonemozu River. The designer has tried
    to blend the building with its surroundings. The structure of
    this building consists of reinforced concrete, a steel frame
    and wooden beams to carry the roof. The roof construction can
    be seen on the second picture on the left. This is a photograph
    of the interior of the exhibition hall. The picture on the right
    shows the interior of a passage to the exhibition hall. The roof
    seems to float above the left wall so light can enter the passage.
    Artificial light coming from spots in the floor lightens up the
    left wall so the distribution of light becomes more equable.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-1">The house is standing on a gentle slope
    without trees or other prominent features. The roof of the house
    has also a slope opposite to the slope of the surroundings. In
    that way the house is protected from strong sea winds (coming
    from the left on the left photograph). The right side is the
    open side as can be seen on the right photograph. The roof has
    an overhang to protect the upper window from direct sunshine
    when the sun stands too high. The window near the ground has
    louvers to regulate the incoming sunshine. When closed variant
    A3 appears otherwise variant A4. Because of the sloping roof
    the ceiling catches more daylight and becomes a little lighter.
    The house is carefully detailed and contemporary protective coatings
    have been used to reinsurance longevity. As can be seen on the
    second picture on the left the plan is linear which characterises
    the work of Murcutt.</FONT></P>
