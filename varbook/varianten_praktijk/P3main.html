    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Tadao Ando combines lines, simple forms, new
    industrial materials with the traditional Japanese style for
    building houses and landscapes. With concrete and abstract forms
    he gives form to space. The Koshino house is composed of two
    parallel concrete boxes which are sunk into a slope of the national
    park. A central courtyard provides for ventilation and light.
    The interior offers sinuous visual games by shadows and light.
    On the right picture you see a concrete wall uncoupled from the
    roof which causes light brushing along the wall.</FONT></P>

    of totally glass facade where the sun doesn't penetrate easily.
    The south-side is totally closed except for the windows near

    <FONT SIZE="-1">Domus is an interactive museum whose purpose
    is to give a better understanding of the human body. The building
    is situated on the top of a cliff along the sea. The meaning
    was to give it a visual connection with the Herculas lighthouse.
    From this the basis for the construction was born: a very simple
    and forceful form which can be seen from a distance. Also the
    climate, strong winds and aggressive waves, made the architect
    chose for a strong and solid form almost without any windows
    as you can see on the left photographs. Daylight is coming from
    above into the open exhibition space through a very large window
    in the roof. The backside of the building consists of pieces
    of wall standing in different directions so the shade of the
    sun gives a very strong and changing contrast to the building
    as can be seen on the right picture. On the other picture on
    the right you can see daylight coming from above into the exhibition
    space. The window is placed along the curved granite wall so
    the daylight brushes past the inside of the wall.</FONT></TD>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">With this museum the architect has tried to combine
    art with architecture to get interesting relationships between
    the art and the spaces. Robert Lund gives each part of the building
    an own identity and a domestic comfort by using texture, light
    and colours. Each space is given a proportion depending on its
    purpose, light and acoustics. The building is build out of many
    different volumes and dynamic constructions. A shipwreck was
    the starting point which has been translated into a building
    integrated into the landscape consisting of sand dunes and vegetation.
    On the right photograph one of the main exhibition halls with
    a tapered form can be seen. Daylight brushes past the wall to
    light up the room.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Marble Arch is built on the rocky coast on
    the east of New York City, overlooking a small bay. The house
    has a sinuous glazed facade which curves along the coast. According
    the great number of windows providing for direct and indirect
    light, the grey granite walls and the darker grey floors, the
    interior gets a very serene character. The warm colour of the
    mahogany panelling contradicts this serene feeling. On the right
    picture you see the swimming pool lit up by a subtle combination
    of daylight and artificial light. The difference in colour between
    daylight and the used artificial light is easy to be seen.</FONT></TD>
