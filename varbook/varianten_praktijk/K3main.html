    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Seijo House faces a heavily trafficked
    street. It is situated between two other houses designed by the
    same architect 5 years earlier as can be seen on the plan on
    the left. Then, he didn't knew he had to built another house
    in the middle. The three houses together have a frontage of 30
    metres. The major problem of the design was to let the house
    mediate between the other two unconnected houses and to create
    a continuous form facing the street. The front of the other two
    houses consists of different layers of walls with openings positioned
    at different places. In that way the architect has tried to reduce
    noise, introduce light and air and to prevent visual intrusion
    from the street. Because of the undefined compositions the architect
    was able to give the house in the middle a strong form and a
    continuous facade as can be seen on the photograph on the left.</FONT></P>
