    <FONT SIZE="-1">Charles and Henry Greene have built several houses
    on the California coast during the first two decades of this
    century. Horizontality characterises the houses. Timber was mostly
    used as the main construction material. Also in this house overlapping
    roofs dominate the wooden structure and characterizes the horizontality.
    The interior gives a dark expression caused by the dark wooden
    walls and the filtering effect of the stained glass windows as
    you can see on the right picture. The main window lights up the
    left wall but the right wall seems to look even darker.</FONT></TD>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">Typical for this house is its cubic volume without
    any details. Adolf Loos regarded ornament as a crime. The composition
    of the exterior is independent of those in the interior.. The
    dimensions of the rooms (including the height) depend on the
    use of the different rooms. More public rooms are higher than
    the more intimate ones. On the right photograph you see the interior
    of the house. The structure of the materials characterises the
    room. Light is coming from a window in the corner of the room.
    As You can see on the left picture the composition of the facade
    is obtained by the position of the windows.</FONT></TD>

    <FONT SIZE="-1">The house, build for a writer Curzio Malaparte
    is located on the edge of a cliff. Starting from a natural rock,
    a stairway leads up to the roof terrace of the house. The upper
    floor of the house is the only one from the three-floor-building
    which takes full advantage of its unique location. The views
    are very beautiful. As you can see on the first picture on the
    right, the landscapes are framed in the windows like works of
    art. On the other picture you see daylight coming into the very
    empty and light (white painted) room.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In 1924 Elien Saarinen was commissioned to
    design a masterplan for two high schools (one for boys and one
    for girls) and an academy of art. The client wanted the complex
    to be a selfsufficient microcosm so also residential accommodation
    for the faculty and staff had to be built. The whole project
    became an enlargement of the design of Saarinen's own residence
    after he assumed directorship of the academy. The architect's
    wife and children designed, build and made the interior like
    the furniture, the wall- and ceiling treatments and the draperies.
    The house shows the creative capacity of the family and the ideology
    of the academy. On the picture on the right the interior of the
    house can be seen. Large windows provide for daylight. Artificial
    light directed to the ceiling makes sure the contrast between
    the walls (with the big windows) and the ceiling doesn't become
    too large.</FONT></TD>
