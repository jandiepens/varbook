    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">According to Mario Botta a museum is a place
    where the values and aesthetics of the past and present are visible.
    Monumentality is the central theme in his work. Botta uses huge
    mathematical forms which reveal nothing about the interior. The
    volumes are positioned symmetrical in a hierarchy with the highest
    point in the middle like a big temple. Daylight Is coming into
    the museum through small openings between the mathematical forms
    so they are not recognisable as windows. The outer walls are
    uncovered brick. The cylindrical tower covers the atrium and
    provides there for daylight. Most of the rooms are illuminated
    by natural top lighting which is possible by making use of a
    staggered design. The pictures on the right show you how diffuse
    natural light comes into the museum.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The client of this houses desired for an open
    plan which also can be used as a gallery for photographic work.
    The result is an open space including a kitchen, livingspace
    and studio which intersects a gallery. The gallery rises to the
    full height of the angular roof. The space seems to have a voluntary
    form and the interior walls are made of rough sawn pine installed
    diagonally which gives the interior an exciting character. The
    example which can be seen on the photograph on the right is a
    little different from variant Q2. The sloping roof causes a asymmetrical
    distribution of daylight. Although there's a window in the right
    wall the amount of daylight in the left side is much more then
    on the right side of the room.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As can be seen on the left picture the Block
    Residence is situated on a spectacular position against a rocky
    hill. The staircases are placed in cylinders which help to carry
    the downhill structure. On the photograph on the right the interior
    of a hall can be seen. In the left wall a horizontal band of
    glass is placed. The band of glass in the middle of the roof
    causes also a strip of light on the right wall with a luminance
    almost as high as the luminance of the windows itself. Of course
    this situation only occurs in case of direct sunlight.</FONT></TD>
