    <FONT SIZE="-1">The original structure was a stone cottage for
    a pump attendant. The building has been enlarged to make it suitable
    to function as a house. The architect has tried to harmonise
    old and new materials while they will still be recognisable as
    old and new as can been seen on the left photograph. The overhang
    of the roof gives unity to the house. On the picture on the right
    the stairs can be seen lightened by daylight and artificial light.
    The windows are placed in a canvas on the same height while the
    artificial light follows the height of the stairs.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The plan of the church is a rectangular nave,
    30 meters long and 16.5 meters wide and high. As can be seen
    on the right photograph three big windows are placed in a convex
    side-wall. The windows are 3.5 meters wide and 5 meters high
    and are connected to the ceiling. From the other wall a 16 meters
    long and 0.5 meters high window illuminates the nave. This window
    is placed close to floor-level . Together the windows illuminate
    the church in a equal way as can be seen on the right picture.</FONT></P>
