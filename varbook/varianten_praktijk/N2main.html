    The Isham House consists of several different buildings around
    a courtyard. When entering the main house, one walks through
    a tall narrow hall. The ceiling of this hall smoothly changes
    over in the tentlike ceiling of the living room. The example
    on the right, showing the interior of the living room, is not
    exactly the same as variant N2. The roof has a slope and daylight
    enters the room slantwise. Still, the likeness with the simulation
    of variant N2 is enormous. Because of the distortion of the variant
    in this example the distribution of daylight in the room is even
    more uniform than in the variant itself. </FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This hospital has an area of  29,000 square
    metres. The structure is made of in situ concrete. Other materials
    that has been used are brick, steel cladding and sheet metal
    roofing. On the photograph on the right the interior of the entrance
    hall can be seen. The facade on the right seems to look like
    an outside facade. The treatment of daylight strengths this feeling.
    A window in the roof against the facade makes sure direct daylight
    enters the building and lightens up the facade from above just
    like it would look like on the outside. Reflection from direct
    sunlight in the windows provides for light-spots on the floor
    and on the back-wall.</FONT></P>
