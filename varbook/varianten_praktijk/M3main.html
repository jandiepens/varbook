    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This studio is situated in a natural landscape
    just outside downtown Los Angeles as you can see on the picture.
    There was en extremely limited budget so only inexpensive materials
    and simple details and forms were used. The windows provide the
    facade for a idiosyncratic composition and the rooms for daylight
    and views to the natural landscape. On the second picture you
    can see the painting studio. Light is coming from several directions
    into the room, but the main direction is coming from the corner.
    The windows are placed nearby the ceiling so paintings can be
    put against the walls.<BR>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Ben van Berkel has become well known in The
    Netherlands for having designed the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam.
    In the house in Amersfoort there's no traditional garden present
    but only inclining planes covered with gravel as can be seen
    on the left photograph. The house has been designed to get a
    maximum amount of daylight. Inner areas have been used to provide
    for the necessary openings for daylight. On the other photograph
    on the left a window near ground level can be seen. On the right
    the interior with the same window can be seen.</FONT></TD>

    This building has a structure made of steel. Because the need
    for columns is minimal, the interior can be used in a very flexible
    way. The walls are made of concrete blocks. The building is because
    of its natural colour and simple geometrical form very neutral.
    Where walls meet each other or the roof windows are placed to
    provide for daylight. This can be seen on the left picture. On
    the picture on the right the interior can be seen. It seems like
    the walls are standing loose from each other and the roof is
    floating. Because most of the daylight is coming from above (like
    outside) the room looks very natural and the distribution is
    equable.</FONT></P>
