    <FONT SIZE="-1">Gabriel Poole built this house and office for
    himself. The main materials that were used are white metal for
    the structure, grey wood for the walls and glass, all very industrial
    so the structure of the house is easy to be recognise. The house
    is designed to function in a hot climate with sometimes sub-tropical
    rains. The skin of the building is dynamic in many ways. Air
    flow, light and sight can be regulated. The different heights
    of the sloping ceilings causes opening for glass strips. These
    openings create a variety of shadows and overall clarity. This
    can be seen on the photograph on the right.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The front of the designed house is traditional.
    The other three sides have a more futuristic look. Each unit
    in the house has its own function. Windows are placed from the
    floor to the roof by each unit to provide for enough daylight.
    This can be seen on the left picture. Reflective glass was used
    to ensure enough privacy. On the right photograph the interior
    of a bedroom under the roof can be seen. The walls and roof are
    white so the room gives a very diffuse and light impression.</FONT></TD>
