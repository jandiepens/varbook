    <FONT SIZE="-1">The architect combines western architecture wit
    traditional Japanese architecture. The building is geometric
    as well as irregular and formless. The landscape is captured
    into the architectural composition of the museum. Pools reflect
    the image of the surroundings. On the picture on the right You
    can see an exhibition room. The windows are placed close to the
    floor so all the walls can be used to show photographs. The picture
    shows very well how the natural light is coming into the room
    and reflects on the floor.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Three buildings were designed as can be seen
    on the picture. The two at the end are made of concrete, containing
    fifteen units each. Balconies and bays domesticate the buildings
    and express the identity of the different units. The frame of
    the centre building is made of steel so larger clearspan units
    could be obtained. The interiors are characterised by high ceilings
    and abundant natural light. On the picture on the right you see
    light coming into the living room from a large window nearby
    the floor. A smaller window nearby the double-height ceiling
    makes sure the light comes also in a vertical direction more
    deeply into the room.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This classic house has been restored and the
    rear section, including a kitchen and bathroom has been completely
    rebuilt. The rear section can be seen on the left picture. The
    interior of the kitchen can be seen on the right. The facade
    of the rear section faces south. To achieve privacy and to prevent
    blindness a large window has been placed near the floor. The
    height of the window was determined by the kitchen furniture
    that cuts through the wooden outer wall and in the garden functions
    as a barbecue. One should consider if the contrast between the
    furniture and windows is really as pleasant as it should be.<BR>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The two houses are placed in such a way that
    both families in the different houses get enough privacy but
    also mutual support from each other as a visible neighbour. The
    houses are built in lightweight transportable materials like
    corrugated iron, which has been used for the walls, the roof
    and the water-tanks. This gives the houses a unity in appearance.
    Murcutt has tried to design walls with traditional materials
    that can moderate the outside environment in a number of different
    ways. Glass louvers on the inside and timber louvers on the outside
    have to regulate the climate. The living areas in the house can
    be turnt into giant verandas, so the need for often narrow and
    unusable traditional verandas wasn't there anymore. On the picture
    on the right the livingroom from one of the two houses can be
    seen with de special designed windows (and louvers). The shadows
    from the louvers on the floor have a very important roll in the
    visible appearance of the interior of the house.<BR>
