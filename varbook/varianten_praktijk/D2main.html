    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This house used to be an 18th-century farm,
    but it has turned into a modern residence. During the reconstruction
    old posts and beams have been kept and traditional materials
    like wooden shingles for the roof have been used. On the picture
    on the right the double-height living room can be seen. According
    to the large window which can be opened totally, the room is
    very bright with nice views to the landscape. The upper rooms
    overlook the living room through indoor windows.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The brick facade of the library arcs around
    an open space at the arrival point of a campus. The architects
    have given the provision of daylight in the building much importance.
    Each area in the building has its own characteristics. Some have
    views to the open air, other to the interior or are totally enclosed
    and private. The photograph on the right shows the interior with
    its natural materials like brick and wood. A big vertical window
    at the end of the corridor gives a view to the outside and provides
    for natural light.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The gallery is composed out of minimal forms
    with neutral colours, so the building becomes a backdrop for
    its art-program. To maintain orientation throughout the building,
    skylight and selective views were introduced. On the picture
    on the right you see daylight coming through a window in the
    left wall and the ceiling. All though the daylight is coming
    mostly from one direction the distribution of light is almost
    equable due to the additional electric spots in the ceiling.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">This chapel stands in a quiet residential
    suburb of Osaka. The main form the building consists of is a
    rectangular volume. A freestanding wall slides at a 15 degree
    angle through the form and divides the church in a chapel and
    a small entry-space as can be seen on the left picture. The horizontal
    and vertical openings seen on the right picture form a cross
    of daylight symmetrically with the chapel.</FONT></P>
