    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Peter Eisenman is always searching for new
    spaces. House VI was his sixthe experiment in questioning the
    essenence of the domestic space on the basis of an inversion
    of its architectural elements. On the picture on the right you
    can seen the bedroom. The beds seem to stand outside the house
    against two pieces of wall. Between these pieces daylight enters
    the room.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The Ischii House has a L-shaped plan with
    a garden at the remaining square. The &quot;foot&quot; of the
    L consists of a living room, 1.5 stories high. The foot consists
    of the other rooms divided over 2 floors. On the photograph on
    the right the interior of the living room can be seen and the
    stairs which lead to the kitchen and dining area. The bare concrete
    and the limited entrance of daylight cause a bare, dark but exiting
    atmosphere.</FONT></TD>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The house has been designed for two couples
    (Schindler and his wife and Chase with his wife). Each individual
    has his or her own self-contained studio so they can live independently
    from each other. Each couple has it's own entrance-hall and bathroom.
    The communal kitchen was designed to be shared by the two couples.
    The house has been build out of precast wall panels made of reinforced
    concrete. The three-inch gaps between the concrete panels were
    either left open for ventilation or filled with glass. On the
    photographs the panels can be seen from the in- and outside.
    On the picture on the right daylight is coming between the panels
    into the room. In the opposite wall bigger windows provide also
    for daylight.</FONT></TD>
