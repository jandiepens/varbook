    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The client wanted a big hall, below enough
    room to exhibit large works of art and above an apartment with
    maximal sight lines and a uniform distribution of natural light.
    The architect has made big windows in the ceiling on a regular
    distance to accomplish a natural and uniform distribution of
    daylight. Just like in the simulation of variant S0 the distribution
    is uniform but the luminance of the ceiling is low which gives
    an unnatural impression and a high contrast between the windows
    in the roof and the ceiling. A possible solution is to lit up
    the ceiling with artificial light.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The section on the left shows the house consists
    of two parts: The garage-barn and the real house. The real house
    steps down the hill which causes many levels in the interior.
    The house is designed to catch as much daylight and solar-heat
    as possible. From the house nice distant views are realised to
    the south and east. The photograph on the right shows the interior
    of the open kitchen. Three windows in the roof illuminate the
    room in a uniform way. The roof is sloping and the windows are
    placed nearby the left wall. In that way daylight enters also
    through the windows in the left wall into the bedrooms on the
    second floor. On the section on the left this is clearly to be
    seen.<BR>
